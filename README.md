## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository contains a full-featured backend for an e-commerce platform with the following capabilities:

- User authentication & authorization (JWT, refresh tokens, roles)
- Product & category management (CRUD, pagination, filtering, searching)
- Shopping cart and order processing (checkout, payments placeholder)
- File uploads (images) via **multer**, file validation, and storage adapters
- Robust MongoDB schema design with indexes and relations
- Redis caching for hot endpoints and sessions
- Rate limiting, input validation, request sanitization, and security hardening
- Background jobs (order processing, email jobs) with queueing 
- Logging, structured errors, and environment-based configuration
- Tests (unit & integration), CI friendly structure, and Docker support
